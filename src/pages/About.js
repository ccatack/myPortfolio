          Hello, Iâ€™m Corbin Atack! I am a newly graduated student of Whitman
          College looking to get started in the software development industry. I
          have skills in full stack and front end development. Since graduating,
          I have been focused expanding my technical skill set by working on
          personal projects. I have also been working on my design skills,
          leveraging my arts background and computer science degree in tandem. I
          see design and development both as creative practices and I am so
          excited to get started with designing and building beautifully
          functional software in an industry setting. <br /> <br />I also do
          other things! I am especially passionate about Ultimate Frisbee. I
          currently play for Seattle BFG, former national and world club champs.
          I also play for the Seattle Cascades, the pro team in Seattle. My
          other hobbies include creating digital art (see my art blog) and
          printmaking.
