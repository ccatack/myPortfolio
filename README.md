## Corbin Atack - Newly graduated web dev

**Welcome to the source of my portfolio. [> Deployed website is here <](https://ccatack.github.io/myPortfolio/)**

I am excited to show the world what I bring to the software development space. I created this project not only to exhibit my experience and skillset, but also to continue to hone my skills in developing with React and expand my toolkit to include [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Massive credit to [Shawn Cooper](https://github.com/scoop1120) for his guidance in developing this site. His insight into creating an elegant development process and writing quality code is so appreciated. I have learned so much from Shawn.
